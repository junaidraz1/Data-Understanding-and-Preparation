This method is often used in training neural networks, where matching the input range to the range of activation functions is important.\n",

    "We can roughly divide categorical variables/features to two types:  ***nominal categorical***  and  ***ordinal categorical*** variables/features. Some cases are clear in terms of which of the two a feature falls into. For example nationality is not an ordered feature, but which grade in school someone is has a natural ordering. **One-hot encoding** was presented in the lectures and will be used in the following exercises with different learning methods.\n",

    "***Nominal categorical features need to be encoded***, because not encoding them implies that they have an order. For example, consider a dataset where you would have rows by different countries, encoded randomly with numbers, for ex. Finland = 1, Norway = 2 and so on. For some analyses and methods this would imply that Norway is somehow \"greater\" in value than Finland. For some algorithms, the implication would also be, that some of the countries would be \"closer\" to each other.\n",

One case is that the categories are not even distance from each other, which is the case with the 'serum_lipid_level' feature with the levels 'normal', 'elevated' and 'at risk'. Its not clear that these are equal in distance from each other. When unsure, it may also be better to one-hot encode, and a lot of packages do it for you behind the scenes. Here we decide to one-hot encode.  \n",

    "1. The difference in explained variance happens because the features weren't scaled. In the non-standardized data, features like age have a much bigger range, so they dominate the variance calculation. This makes PCA focus mostly on these features, giving a high explained variance of 1.00. After scaling the features, they all have the same range of standard deviation i.e. 1. So each feature contributes equally to the variance. This makes the explained variance more balanced and lowers it to 0.64.\n",
