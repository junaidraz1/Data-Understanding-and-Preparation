# ðŸ§  **Data Understanding & Data Preparation in CRISP-DM**

### Overview
In this exercise, we focus on the **Data Understanding** and **Data Preparation** stages of the CRISP-DM model, which are essential for ensuring the quality and suitability of data before diving into analysis. During these stages, we address questions such as:

- **Is the data quality sufficient?**
- **How can we check for issues in the data?**
- **How can we clean and transform the data for modeling?**

### Importance of Data Checks
Before building a model, it's crucial to **check the data quality**. Skipping this step might lead to inaccurate results, invalid conclusions, and misleading interpretations. Hence, it is essential to **plot, clean, and verify** the data before applying any machine learning or statistical models.

### What Weâ€™ll Do
1. **Data Validation**: We'll first familiarize ourselves with the dataset by **visualizing** and **inspecting** it for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
2. **Data Cleaning**: We'll clean the data by handling missing values, correcting erroneous entries, and filtering out unwanted noise.
3. **Data Transformation**: We'll apply necessary **data transformations** to ensure the data is in the right format for further modeling and analysis. This includes scaling, normalization, and encoding categorical variables if required.
4. **Multi-Dimensional Plotting**: We'll explore techniques for **visualizing multi-dimensional data**, using scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, to detect relationships, trends, and anomalies in the data.

### Why Data Preparation Matters
By rigorously checking the data at this stage, we can ensure:
- **Data Integrity**: The data is accurate, reliable, and ready for analysis.
- **Improved Models**: Clean, well-prepared data leads to more effective and insightful models.
- **Actionable Insights**: Proper data checks ensure that the insights drawn from the analysis are trustworthy and meaningful.

In this exercise, weâ€™ll learn how to efficiently and effectively prepare the dataset for the next stages of the CRISP-DM process, ensuring that our analysis is built on a solid foundation.
